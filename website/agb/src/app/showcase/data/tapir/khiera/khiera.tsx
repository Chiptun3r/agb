      <p>
        Khiera&apos;s quest is a platforming game about where the direction of
        gravity isn&apos;t always fixed. You&apos;ll find yourself jumping
        between planets, asteroids and other strange satellites to collect
        power-ups which will let you progress further. You will need to
        backtrack to previous locations to complete your quest.
