        &lsquo;The Hat Chooses the Wizard&rsquo; is a 2D platformer. This game
        was developed as an entry for the GMTK game jam 2021, with the theme
        &ldquo;joined together&rdquo;. The entire game, except for the music,
        was produced in just 48 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this game, you play as a wizard searching for his missing staff.
        However, the path to the staff is filled with dangerous obstacles and
        monsters. Luckily, you have a powerful magic hat that can be thrown and
        recalled, allowing you to fly towards it and reach otherwise
        inaccessible platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this unique mechanic, you can explore the game&apos;s levels and
        defeat enemies. The game&apos;s simple but challenging gameplay will put
        your platforming skills to the test as you try to reach the end.
