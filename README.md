# Rust for the Gameboy Advance

This is my in development library for rust on the gameboy advance. It uses
information from GbaTek, Tonc, and the existing
[rust-console/gba](https://github.com/rust-console/gba). Namely the gba.json
file comes from [rust-console/gba](https://github.com/rust-console/gba).

Note that this currently contains no documentation of any kind, unless you count
examples as documentation.

## Requirements

* Nightly rust, probably quite a recent version.
* Devkitarm.

This is probably easiest to do in a container.
